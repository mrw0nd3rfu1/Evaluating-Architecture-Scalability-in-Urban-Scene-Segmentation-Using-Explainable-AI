# Urban Scene Segmentation with SegFormer – Transfer Learning & Explainable AI

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation used in the research paper:

**“Evaluating Architecture Scalability and Transfer Learning in Urban Scene Segmentation Using Explainable AI.”**

The project investigates how different **SegFormer variants (B3, B4, B5)** scale on smaller datasets and how well they transfer to geographically different driving environments using transfer learning.

The notebook implements:

* Transformer-based semantic segmentation
* Cross-dataset transfer learning
* Evaluation using mIoU and class-level metrics
* Explainable AI through confidence heatmaps
